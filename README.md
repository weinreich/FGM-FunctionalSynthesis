FGM-FunctionalSynthesis
=======================

Code developed in support of Weinreich and Knies 2013 "FISHERâ€™S GEOMETRIC MODEL OF ADAPTATION MEETS THE FUNCTIONAL SYNTHESIS: DATA ON PAIRWISE EPISTASIS FOR FITNESS YIELDS INSIGHTS INTO THE SHAPE AND SIZE OF PHENOTYPE SPACE "

All simulations run in MABLAB R2011a (version 7.12.0.635). The main action is in TestEqn4.m (which yielded figures 4 and 5) and TestEqn6.m (which yielded Table 2). Estimate_n_from_datasets.m and LunzerSlidingWindow.m yielded figures 6 and 7, respectively. Everything else is subroutines in support of the others.
